README

We'd like to thank the TAs for all their help.

We believe we have implemented everything required in the
specifications

Departures from recommended calling conventions:
- We use Register r1 to point to the top off the value stack, not as a
  return register
- The only block we return values from is the has block in the
  calc40.ums module. It used r4 as a register for holding a return
  value
- When we send values as 'arguments' in the print module, we use r3 as
  argument register

Print module:
- We chose to iterate through the value stack using a loop, printing
  each individual value recursively.

Hours spent analyzing the assignment:
- 6 hours approximately

Hours spent writing assembly code
- 8 hours approximately

Hours spent debugging our calculator
- 4 hours approximately
